## by (Khaled Yaseen)


## Datasets

> I analyzed and explored data from 6 Datasets, 5 Datasets (Athletes, Teams, Medals, Coaches, and Gender) for Tokyo 2020. And one dataset (Country_Medals_from_1896_to_2020) for the history of the olympics games from 1896 to 2020. In the notebook, I checked the data cleaning and consistency then I did the exploratory and Explanatory Processes through Tableau.



## Almost, The datasets were redy and I did small cleaning operations. After cleaning the data i started to pose questions and analyze data Throght Tableau.
### The most important findings From country medals from 1896 to 2020:

- London is the only city to host the olpmpics 3 times (1908, 1948, 2012).
- Tokyo, Los Anglos, and Athens, all hosted the Olympics 2 times.
- The most number of medals occurred in Tokyo 2020 with 1080 medals. It is the first time to be more than 1000 medals in an Olympic game.
- The USA is the most country won medals in the history of the Olympics with a total of 2630 medals( 738 Bronze, 832 Silver, and 1060 Gold)   then the surprise for me the second country is the ancient soviet union with a total of 1010 medals despite it broke in 1992 which means it  lost 8 Tournaments !!.


### The most important findings From Tokyo 2020 tournament Datasets:

- The General main statistics are : Total Athletes: 11062, Female Athletes: 5432, Male Athletes: 5882, Total Coaches: 381, Total Plays: 46, Total Country Teams: 93, Total Medals: 1080.
- USA is the First country in athletes with 615 athletes, then Japan with 586 athletes.
- USA is the first country in medals with 113 medals (33 Bronze, 41 Silver, And 39 Gold), then China with 88 medals (18 Bronze, 22 Silver, And 38 Gold).
- The Athletics Play has the largest number of athletes with 2068, Swimmung with 743 athletes, then Football with 567 athletes.
- Japan has the most number of Coashes in Tokyo 2020 With 35 Coashes, Then USA with 28 Coashes, And Spain with 26 Coashes.
- Japan has the largest number of teams in Tokyo 2020 with 45 teams, then USA with 43 teams, And Italy with 34 teams. I think Japan didn't get the best result in comparison with their preparation because Japan ranked 5 in medals with 58 medals.
- Basket Ball has the most number of coashes in 2020 with 74 coashes, then Footbal with 59 coashes, And artistic swimming with 58 coashes.

## I also did the explanatory process with Tableau software to make insightful dashboards.
